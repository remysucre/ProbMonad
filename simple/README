`ghc SimuInf.hs` builds binary
`./SimuInf B` runs and prints problem B if implemented
`./SimuInf diecoins` runs an example that demonstrates inference implementation 

Simulation Interface has abstractions and implementation for modeling, and
Inference Interface has abstractions and implementation for infering. 

Simulation Problems and Inference Problems have solution code to the problems.
